# BDSC Data Viz & Storytelling Workshop
Event Date: April 5, 2023

## The Datasets

Welcome and thank you for being a part of the 2023 BDSC Data Viz & Storytelling workshop!
Please use one of the following datasets for the workshop:

- Buffalo, NY Recycling: https://data.buffalony.gov/Quality-of-Life/Monthly-Recycling-and-Waste-Collection-Statistics/2cjd-uvx7
- Buffalo Neighborhood Metrics: https://data.buffalony.gov/Economic-Neighborhood-Development/Neighborhood-Metrics/adai-75jt
- Buffalo Open Expenditures: https://data.buffalony.gov/Government/Open-Expenditures-Filtered/bktd-jwim
- Washington State Electric Vehicles: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-title-and-registration-activity

## Getting Started

If you are newer to data visualization or would prefer to get a quick start, consider using either of the Python notebooks available in this repo. These are:

- `bdsc-dataviz.ipynb` - code to access the datasets and some example visual code
- `bdsc-dataviz-pygwalker.ipynb` - an interactive drag-and-drop UI for quick visuals

We recommend downloading these notebooks and opening them in Google Colaboratory: https://colab.research.google.com. Google Colab is a great tool for coding in Python without installing anything to your laptop.

## Guidelines

Everyone will have approximately 1.5 hours to work with their dataset of choice. Explore your dataset, get to know it, ask questions, and try to visualize answers to your questions. What are some insights that would help enlighten your own life? Are there any business scenarios that could benefit from your findings? Can your frame your data story in terms of a business proposal, or perhaps a case to change people's minds about a certain topic? For example, 

- Feel free to supplement with outside data, but beware that this may take precious time
- We encourage you to work with other attendees - it's a great way to make connections, learn from others, and maximize brainstorming
- Most importantly, HAVE FUN and ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS!

Thank you to Kangarootime, Kevin Chang, Vi Ly, Tyler Rinker, and Jillian Shepard for making this workshop a reality!
