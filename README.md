# BDSC Data Viz & Storytelling Workshop
Event Date: April 5, 2023

Welcome and thank you for being a part of the 2023 BDSC Data Viz & Storytelling workshop!
Please use one of the following datasets for the workshop:

- Buffalo, NY Recycling: https://data.buffalony.gov/Quality-of-Life/Monthly-Recycling-and-Waste-Collection-Statistics/2cjd-uvx7
- Buffalo Neighborhood Metrics: https://data.buffalony.gov/Economic-Neighborhood-Development/Neighborhood-Metrics/adai-75jt
- Buffalo Open Expenditures: https://data.buffalony.gov/Government/Open-Expenditures-Filtered/bktd-jwim
- Washington State Electric Vehicles: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-title-and-registration-activity

If you are newer to data visualization or would prefer to get a quick start, consider using either of the Python notebooks available in this repo. These are:

- `bdsc-dataviz.ipynb` - code to access the datasets and some example visual code
- `bdsc-dataviz-pygwalker.ipynb` - an interactive drag-and-drop UI for quick visuals

We recommend downloading these notebooks and opening them in Google Colaboratory: https://colab.research.google.com
Google Colab is a great tool for coding in Python without installing anything to your laptop.

Thank you to Kangarootime, Kevin Chang, Vi Ly, Tyler Rinker, and Jillian Shepard for making this workshop a reality!
